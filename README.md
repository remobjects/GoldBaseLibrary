# GoBaseLibrary

The Go Base Library is a small library that can be optionally used in Go projects compiled with the [RemObjects Gold](http://elementscompiler.com/gold) compiler. It provides some of the core types, classes and functions that, while not part of the Go language spec per se, are commonly used in Go apps

The code for the this library is open source and available under a liberal license. We appreciate contributions.
